# EAST Text Detection Project

This project implements text detection using the Efficient and Accurate Scene Text (EAST) model in TensorFlow. The code processes images, detects text, and applies Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to filter bounding boxes.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- TensorFlow 
- TensorFlow Slim (`tf-slim`)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- shapely
  

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy tf-slim
```
